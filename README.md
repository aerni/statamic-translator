Translator provides a simple and intuitive way to translate your Statamic content with the click of a button. It's as simple as it gets!. [Read the documentation](https://statamic.com/addons/aerni/translator/docs) to learn how to install, setup and use this addon.

## Translation Services
Translator uses `Google Cloud Translation` for translation. You can choose between the `Basic` and `Advanced` Cloud Translation edition. They both deliver the same translation. The `Basic` edition can be set up using a simple `API Key`, while the setup of the `Advanced` edition is a little bit more complicated. Which one you choose really comes down to the project's requirements and personal preference.
